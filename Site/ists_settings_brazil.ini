The shopping center has five floors with 450 businesses, nearly 200 are devoted to the world of rock and other musical styles such as hip hop, funk and others.<br \><br \>Street Art <br \>When in São Paulo, you can’t miss the work of Os Gêmeos, Brazil’s best known street artists. They’re twins from São Paulo who have added art works to cities around the world. Their work is easily recognizable as it usually includes distinctive yellow faces, a rainbow of bright colors and surreal images. They are invited to paint places legally and, for example, received a commission to paint a mural on the wall of the Modern Art Museum of São Paulo in Parque Ibirapuera<br \><br \>Streets of Paraty<br \>Paraty is one of Brazil’s most appealing destinations.Paraty’s colonial center is remarkable not only for its exquisitely preserved, centuries-old architecture, but also for its lack of automobile traffic.

The sweet balls are made by simmering condensed milk with cocoa powder, then whisking in butter and shaping the mix into balls before rolling in chocolate sprinkles.<br \><br \>Culture:<br \>At present, Brazil has a population of about 190 million people. Of these, more than half are white (which includes Portuguese, Italian, Polish etc... individuals), just fewer than 40% are mixed black and white and less than 10% are black.<br \>When invited to dinner or an event, do not under-dress. It is considered more appropriate to over-dress than to appear too casual in appearance.<br \> Always bring the hostess a small gift of gratitude (such as a glass of wine or some fresh flowers).<br \> Avoid giving anyone a gift that is black or purple, as these are perceived as mourning colours. <br \>"
