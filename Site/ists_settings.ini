about="Russia has a lot of popular sights in St. Petersburg to visit, such as <br \><br \>The State Hermitage Museum <br \>St. Petersburg's most popular visitor attraction, and one of the world's largest and most prestigious museums, the Hermitage is a must-see for all first-time travellers to the city. With over 3 million items in its collection, it also definitely rewards repeat visits, and new-comers can only hope to get a brief taste of the riches on offer here, from Impressionist masterpieces to fascinating Oriental treasures. One estimate has it that you would need eleven years to view each exhibit on display for just one minute, so many visitors prefer to organize a guided tour to ensure they have time to catch all the collection's highlights. Art aficionados, however, may find it more rewarding to seek out for themselves the works that they are particularly interested in.<br \><br \>Peterhof Park and Palaces <br \>Versailles was, however, the inspiration for Peter the Great's desire to build an imperial palace in the suburbs of his new city and, after an aborted attempt at Strelna, Peterhof - which means 'Peter's Court' in German - became the site for the Tsar's Monplaisir Palace, and then of the original Grand Palace. The estate was equally popular with Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth, who ordered the expansion of the Grand Palace and greatly extended the park and the famous system of fountains, including the truly spectacular Grand Cascade.<br \><br \><br \>Pavlovsk Park<br \>Although Pavlovsk's Park has nothing like the architectural wealth that can be seen at Pushkin or Peterhof, it is one of the most charming and extensive green spaces in or around St. Petersburg, and one of the largest landscaped gardens in the world.<br \><br \>Fun Things to Do (Entertainment):<br \>The Bolshoi Theater offers world famous ballet and opera programs during all but summer months.<br \>Extraordinary dramatic theaters, such as the Moscow Art Theater has performed plays by classic playwrights such as a Chekhov. <br \>The world famous Obraztsov Puppet Theater are prime attractions for families. Both <br \>Moscow Conservatory has concerts and recitals featuring Russia’s best musical performers.<br \><br \>Food:<br \><br \>Pelmeni: <br \>It’s a type of pastry dumpling typically filled with meat. Several ways to serve it, slathered in butter, topped with sourcream or served in a broth.<br \><br \>Bilini:<br \>If you’re a big fan of breakfast, you should try out Blini. They are thin pancakes like crepe and said to symbolize the sun- warm, round, and golden.<br \><br \>Vodka:<br \>Who can forget, the main dish, Vodka. <br \><br \><br \>Culture:<br \>First thing that should come in mind is the Russian nesting dolls. They are well-known symbols of the country, the paintings of each doll, can be extremely elaborate and usually symbolizes a Russian peasant girl in traditional costume.<br \>"
