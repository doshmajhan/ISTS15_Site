about="Places to Visit (Attractions):<br \><br \>Niagara Falls - Canada's most famous natural attraction. Located just over an hour's drive from Toronto, along the American border, these massive falls drop approximately 57 meters. Visitors can see the falls at an astoundingly close distance from the edge at their top. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries there were numerous attempts to plunge over the falls in various types of homemade boats and barrels. This, along with tightrope walkers and other spectacles, led to the adjacent town of Niagara Falls developing a carnival type atmosphere that persists today. <br \><br \>Banff National Park and the Rocky Mountains - <br \>Banff National Park lies in the heart of the majestic Rocky Mountains in the province of Alberta. Scenes like the turquoise green lakes, snow-capped peaks, and glaciers are all easily accessible in this stunning park. The jewel of the park is the Lake Louise, where green waters reflect the surrounding mountains and visitors can stroll easily around the shores. In winter Banff is also a major winter sports area and home to Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village, two of Canada's most prominent ski destinations.<br \><br \>Toronto’s CN Tower -<br \>On the shores of Lake Ontario in Canada's biggest city is the iconic CN Tower, one of Canada's most famous landmarks. The tower is one of the tallest structures in the world standing 553 meters high. It offers fine dining in its revolving restaurant, 360, where visitors can enjoy a meal while looking out over the city and lake. There is also the LookOut and the Glass Floor, offering beautiful views out over the city and beyond. Even those who choose not to go up the tower will find themselves stopping to stare at the structure, which is visible from almost everywhere in the city. At night, the tower is lit in different colors.<br \><br \>Fun Things to Do (Entertainment):<br \><br \>Hotel de Glace -- Quebec City<br \>Forego a sweaty and crowded trip to Disney World for an unforgettable visit to the Hotel de Glace in Quebec City. The iconic ice hotel offers spring break fun for the entire family with a dose of education on Canada's aboriginal groups too. The annual ice hotel features a skating rink, an ice slide, ice carvings, hot cocoa for the kids and those much-needed spring break cocktails served in ice glasses for the adults. Opt for an overnight stay while the hotel is open between Jan. 4 and March 28, or pay a visit for a small admission fee.<br \><br \>Lake Superior<br \>Nipigon, Ontario, is the closest town to the Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area -- a conservation area on Lake Superior's northern shore. The lake is known for its frigid temperatures even in the summer months, but the frozen water turns into a playground for outdoor enthusiasts in winter. Visitors can winter camp in the Pukaskwa National Park of Canada and enjoy immediate access to some of the nation's most scenic snowmobiling, snowshoeing, dog sledding, ice fishing, winter hiking and more.<br \><br \>Food:<br \><br \>Poutine –<br \>A real poutine uses peppery meat-based gravy and “squeaky” curds on fries.<br \><br \>Canadian Bacon –<br \>What’s known in our country as “peameal bacon” is branded as Canadian bacon just about everywhere else. Unlike traditional bacon, which comes from the pig’s belly, Canadian bacon is lean pork loin that’s been brined and rolled in cornmea<br \><br \>Caesar – <br \>Invented in 1969 by Calgary restaurant manager Walter Chell, this cocktail took off to become enormously popular from there. (Clamato-maker Mott’s claims more than 350-million Caesars are sold every year.) Its key ingredients are clamato juice, vodka, Worchester and a salted rim.<br \>Culture:<br \>Canadians differ from one another. Ethnic background and place of residence are important factors in determining peoples’ level of comfort with touching and gestures.<br \>In general, however, Canadians expect a high degree of respect for public and especially for private property and space. Canadians generally have a very strong sense of space (no more or less than an arm’s length); particularly when speaking or dealing with strangers. It is best to carefully observe each person’s degree of comfort with touching and their preference for personal space.<br \>Canadians will not necessarily maintain constant eye contact, but it is considered a sign of dishonesty or insecurity if a person refuses to or is reluctant to make eye contact.<br \>Also scorned are some personal habits associated with other cultures such as clearing one’s throat aggressively, not wearing deodorant, burping in public, slurping, chewing with one’s mouth open or spitting.<br \>Canadians usually shake hands with both men and women, particularly in a public or professional setting. In some cases, especially among friends in French-speaking circles, men and women will often give each other a kiss on each cheek. In English Canada, good friends will sometimes hug each other. Generally, men do not touch other men beyond the standard handshake unless they have reached a fairly high level of comfort with that person or they are playing sports. This rule is similar for contact between men and women. Women are less bound by these rules. However, holding hands and repeated or prolonged physical contact is reserved for ’intimate’ and/or exclusive relationships or family (ie: not between friends). Family members will often maintain close physical contact with young children.<br \>Many Canadians find a lot of hand movement while talking distracting or even annoying; some see it as a sign of insecurity. Nevertheless, Canadians may expect people of other cultures to use more hand movements and gestures. Mentioning the possible difference may be a way of gauging peoples’ responses.<br \>One gesture to avoid is waiving the index finger from side to side. This is normally used with children and means, 'no, you can’t do that'.<br \>"
